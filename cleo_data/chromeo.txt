In comparison to him, I'm just a peasant
From the moment he stepped into class I felt my reputation slashed in half and stashed away beneath his presence.
“I'm the coolest thing you'll ever know so you can call me Chromeo” cuz I'm lacking any awkward adolescence.;

The kids smile from ear to ear as they learn he was held back a year for starting fights and failing all his lessons
Lord with all my heart and all my youth I pray to be as cool as you.;

Hey now, any day now, who ever loved that loved not at first sight?
Hey hey now, lost my way now, all through the day, and into the night.;

He's got everything you wish you had to show.
All the highs and none the lows.
He's the boys, he's Chromeo.
Everything you wish you had to show.
All the highs and none the lows.
He's the boys, he's Chromeo;

Now if Chromeo says he needs a lover,
Then girls were boring any way, and maybe if I'm gay he’ll say I'm cool enough to hang with in the summer.;

School is pointless, don't ya know?
That's why I skip class with Chromeo and we get high in his basement but I'm a bummer.
Cuz I say I don't like how it feels and Chromeo says that what appeals to him just don't appeal to my mother.;

I guess that's just the way it goes -
Jumping bridge for Chromeo.
Stranger things have been taken too far.
Oh, Chromeo
Sweet Chromeo
Don't break my fuckin’ heart.;
