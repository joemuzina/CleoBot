Short cut to a quick buck is working all the time,
Renting out your mind,
And saving every dime,
Because when ten of those combine,
They cross a sacred line,
And go from pocket change
To a gold mine.;

She said she'd be down to hang out -
With her parents out of town, she was hoping I'm around
For a party at her vacant place.;

I said I'd come - showed up and felt out of place.
So I headed home.
That's when she text my phone and ask me where
I was and when I said I was gone;

She broke my spine,
And in that pain,
I realized that every dime I'd ever saved wasn't worth anything;

What's the drive in being alive
When you don't know who you are?
What's the fun in getting drunk
If you can't take it too far?;

Yeah my friends are saying
I've been wasting all my weekends contemplating
If it's me or the booze that really gets wasted.
I don't even taste it;

When I'm throwing back shots as if its a race then
Quickly chase them;

WITHOUT A MOUTH I'M SO DOWN,
MY HOMETOWN ONLY MAKES ME FEEL ALONE!;

Hometown girls are my greatest fear
So in a couple days I'll be off to college for another year,
thinkin' I'm gettin' away by hitting the road.
Somehow she make it to all of my shows now where can I go?;

Girl it's a simple a matter,
Put your painted finger on my tongue -
So I can taste the lacquer,
And relive each door that you have touched.;

And then she split my lips!
And for three whole days,
I tried to speak but everyone agreed
They couldn't hear a word I'd say!;

What's the drive in being alive
When you don't know who you are?
What's the fun in getting drunk
If you can't take it too far?;

I'm singing oh I don't know
Take me anywhere but home;

WITHOUT A MOUTH I'M SO DOWN,
MY HOMETOWN ONLY MAKES ME FEEL ALONE!;

Then just when I think I'm in the clear,
She hooked her hair behind her ears and says I'm
Going down;

She said baby it's okay to feel
The way you do if you keep it to yourself.;

Life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips,
But it sure ain't no fun with no teeth and no tongue;

I say life is a bitch with no mouth and no lips,
I SAY LIFE IS A BITCH WITH NO MOUTH AND NO LIPS!;

WITHOUT A MOUTH I'M SO DOWN,
MY HOMETOWN ONLY MAKES ME FEEL ALONE!;

Then just when I think I'm in the clear,
She hooked her hair behind her ears,
Says babe are you aware
Of who I am?!
