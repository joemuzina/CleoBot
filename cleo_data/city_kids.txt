Tell my love to wait,
'Cause I'm not feeling too great.
And since it started raining, I got this kind of pain in the left side of my brain, and it just won't go away.;

I'm falling apart again.
All my love gets lost again.;

Then you pray for luck, against the odds,
Yet in the city, we're our own gods.
And then I get thinking it may just be fine.
Hey no harm,
Sitting pretty
I'm too far gone.;

Tell my love to stop,
'Cause I'm not feelin' too hot.
And it's my understanding, that they faked the whole moon landing, oh every election's planned man, like ten years in advance man.;
