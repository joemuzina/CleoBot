Lukey honey have you lost yourself?
I said I think I've lost my will and all.
I know I'm young, but I'm scared of hell, does God know if I've been running through these halls?;

Crucify a child's mind.
Tell him true friends are hard to find.
But in the wrong place at the right time,
Lord knows, I found mine.;

Children, children, take a look at yourselves!
A gold star if you fit inside the norms.
And all the others pray to save yourselves,
A bunch of sinners from the moment you were born.;

But don't ask why, Lord we're born to die - it's the human curse.
It's a genocide.
But they could have been white, so it could have been worse!;
