Friday night, the party’s alright
But no one really gives a fuck if I don't end up showing up tonight.
And I gotta say, that this week, has got me beat baby.;

How come everything important, only happens when I'm dormant?
Why does everything that's neat only happen when I sleep?;

I'm at home in my bed, alone
Thinking who's the one that's gonna take you home?
Singing baby it's okay...
It happens every day.;

Now I'm all for getting fucked up in a field,
But there's just one issue - no walls to sink my roots into.;

You say your fucking love is real...
but I always catch you falling back
On hockey boys in baseball caps.;

With shit for brains it's a constant train of spitting, dip, and taking names,
But oh I'm still safe in my sheets.
Wondering why everything important only happens when I'm dormant?
Why does everything that's neat only happen when I sleep?;

What's it mean?;

I'm at home in my bed alone, thinking who's the one that's gonna take you home?
Singing baby it's okay...
It happens every day.;

Eyes that conspire, do no wrong.
They just stare too long.;

As the knees, above my feet
Start to crease in my moment of clarity.;

Now I see
That a pirate's life's the life for me,
Yeah a pirate's life's the life for me.;

She said “What's it mean to be nineteen”?!
I said "sail the seas - all seven clean!";

Short and sweet
You and me;

You and me live defeated till our feet hit the sand, top the tide, to the wind screaming fuck the dry land can't be beat.
Oh just you and me.;
