I told you I have it, my flow fuckin' nasty,
My boys fuckin' back me, I'm good.
I found my place.
It's in the look on Sanjay's face when I say
The boys is getting faded
At a spot that's caught between Wilson and Adelaide.;

And I said,
Is this how it ends?;

Didn't fuck with me in high school,
Now you're acting like my friend?!;

These ladies say they love me,
But they do not mean it.
They're like "Lukey, honey, bunny, baby",
I say fuckin' beat it!;

If Sanjay says we're calling in tomorrow,
Then we do.
If Shorten says he's going into the morning,
Then me too.;

If Sanjay says he's calling in tomorrow,
Then we do.
If Shorten says he's going into the morning,
Then me too.;

I've come down with a bit of a cold so I'm not going to be coming in today,
Thank you.
Good job, brother. Good job.;
