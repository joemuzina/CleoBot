You're wasting your time,
She says only the lonely people in my life saw me lost in the moment.;

And down on my knees as I beg and I plead,
For some time in your sheets so I can get what I need,
Oh yeah!;

Straight struck by her figure -
Plot worsen shower curtain as she pulls bernard's trigger.;

And I hope and I pray, that it's going to fit her.
But with Marlboro lips how the fuck am I gonna quit her?;

Late in the night, I'm wondering like, who are you, are you, baby?
The thorn in my side, or just my type?;

I know it's wrong, but I still want this -
Bad love, too much, your touch - my lonely heart can't get enough;

She sit there making fun of my tendency to fumble buttons,
Frequency of quickly coming
To make me feel like I'm yours.;

I push my friends against the fence.
She on the hunt for finger prints
Or circumstantial evidence.
The things I'll do just to score...;

But late in the night, I'm wondering like who are you, are you, baby?
The thorn in my side, or just my type?;

I know it's wrong, but I still want this.
Bad love, too much, your touch - my lonely heart can't get enough.;

Talking sweet sins, wet wick, calling my bluffs.
Like text and sex, I feel the same.
Talking homicidal thoughts and growing pains...;
